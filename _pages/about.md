I am deeply committed to advancing the field of robotics with a focus on the integration of cognitive and athletic intelligence to create robotics foundation models that could revolutionize our modern industry and society.

Please refer to my CV [here](http://DavidLXu.github.io/files/Lixin_EN_Resume.pdf)

In my university years, I took part in a robot association where I did a couple of successful robot competitions for college students. During that period, I gained experience in programming the MCUs for motion control, as well as computer vision, which was also the topic of my graduation project.

For my master's program at Georgia tech, I took both ECE and CS courses with straight A scores. I took ECE classes like image processing, C++ programming, linear systems, random processes, etc. My CS classes include machine learning, deep learning, and robot intelligence. <!--Multiple class projects laid a solid foundation for me to carry on my research in robotics.-->

I came to Tianjin University for my master's thesis featuring the control and digital twin for parallel robotics. Finished a paper in Trans. Mechatronics that is still under review. For graduation, I am doing digital twins of robotics in simulation environments working for further decision making and control algorithms.

I'm currently in NUS as a visiting intern in Prof. Lin Shao’s group working on a project of cross-embodiment dexterous hand grasping based on generative models and RL.

Miscellaneous
===

**Sports: skiing, hiking, biking, table tennis**

I like skiing, and I went skiing 5 times this winter. I also like hiking and biking, especially in natural resorts. I'm also a table tennis player from a very young age.

**Traveling: 6 countries, 21 domestic provinces**

Driven by my wanderlust, I have journeyed to 6 different countries (Singapore, France, Czechia, Austria, Hungary) and 21 provinces in China.

**Languages: CN, EN, DE, JP**

I'm a language enthusiast. My preferred languages: Chinese (native), English (IELTS7.5/GRE322), German (roughly B1), Japanese (roughly N4), and Cantonese (beginner).


Two persons I admire the most:  Geoffrey Hinton for his dedication to neural net research and Elon Musk for his aspiration and enthusiasm.
