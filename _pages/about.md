I am deeply committed to advancing the field of robotics with a focus on the integration of cognitive and athletic intelligence to
create humanoid robots that could revolutionize our modern industry and society.

About
===
I am currently a senior undergraduate student, working with Associate Professor Jie Yang in the field of SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping). I will graduate as a Bachelor of Engineering from Department of Mechanical and Electircal Enginnering in July 2021.
My research interests are in computer vision and robotics, particularly 3D vision, unsupervised learning and their applications in robotics. I will be joining the GTSI and SPIOEE dual degree master program as a student starting from Fall 2021.

Research Experiences
===
I am broadly interested in compter engimachine learning systems that can perceive the world as we human do, which I believe is the cornerstone of achieving AGI. In my exploration of this goal, I have studied and done research in medical image analysis, efficient inference, unsupervised learning and 3D vision. I have had the great fortune to participate in several interesting projects with inspiring and talented collaborators.

In the summer of 2020 and winter of 2021, I engaged research at Universal Village, Boston, USA, where I worked with Professor Yanjun Fang on the adversarial attack and defense tasks in 3D point clouds. We combined implicit function networks with a novel optimization process for accurate point cloud restoration.

Prior to that, I worked on efficient inference for computer vision algorithms under the supervision of Professor Jie Zhou and Jiwen Lu in IVG. We applied binary neural networks (BNNs) for object detection and leveraged the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle to improve their performance.

Previously, I had experience in medical image analysis in my sophomore year, advised by Professor Jianjiang Feng.

Miscellaneous
===
I like swimming and I am particularly good at freestyle, reaching national second level athlete in Men's 100m Freestyle. I also like basketball. My favorite player is LeBron James.

I am also an Anime fan and a lover of Galgame. Some of my favorite works are Fate/stay night, Hyouka, Steins;Gate, Attack on Titan and EVA.

Two persons I admire the most: Kaiming He for his outstanding research tastes and Elon Musk for his aspiration and enthusiasm.
