I am deeply committed to advancing the field of robotics with a focus on the integration of cognitive and athletic intelligence to create robotics foundation models that could revolutionize our modern industry and society.

Please refer to my CV [here](http://davidlxu.github.io/files/Lixin_EN_Resume.pdf)

I'm currently in Tsinghua AIR working as a visiting intern in [Prof. Yilun Chen](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1621.htm)'s group for dexterous policy and sim2real deployment. Before that, I work as a visiting intern in [Prof. Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io)’s group in National University of Singapore. Before that, I was a master student at Georgia tech. Took ECE and CS courses like image processing, C++ programming, random processes, machine learning, deep learning, and robot intelligence with straight-A scores.
I completed bachelors in Qingdao University with a major of Mechanical Engineering, where I did a couple of successful robot competitions for university students, and gained experience in embedded systesm, motion control, as well as computer vision, which was also the topic of my undergrad thesis.

Miscellaneous
===

**Sports: skiing, hiking, biking, table tennis**

I like skiing, and I went skiing 5 times this winter. I also like hiking and biking, especially in natural resorts. I'm also a table tennis player from a very young age.

**Traveling: 6 countries, 21 domestic provinces**

Driven by my wanderlust, I have journeyed to 6 different countries (Singapore, France, Czechia, Austria, Hungary) and 21 provinces in China.

**Languages: CN, EN, DE, JP**

I'm a language enthusiast. My preferred languages: Chinese (native), English (IELTS7.5/GRE322), German (roughly B1), Japanese (roughly N4), and Cantonese (beginner).


Two persons I admire the most:  Geoffrey Hinton for his dedication to neural net research and Elon Musk for his aspiration and enthusiasm.
