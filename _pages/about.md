I am deeply committed to advancing the field of robotics with a focus on the integration of cognitive and athletic intelligence to create robotics foundation models that could revolutionize our modern industry and society.

Please refer to my CV [here](http://davidlxu.github.io/files/Lixin_EN_Resume.pdf)

I am currently a PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), supervised by [Prof. Renjing Xu](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/faculty-personal-page?id=97).

Previously, I was a visiting intern in [Prof. Yilun Chen](https://air.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1046/1621.htm)'s group at Tsinghua AIR, and in [Prof. Lin Shao](https://linsats.github.io)’s group in National University of Singapore, focusing on dexterous policy learning and sim-to-real deployment.

I earned my Master’s degree at Georgia Tech, where I took ECE and CS courses—including image processing, C++ programming, random processes, machine learning, deep learning, and robot intelligence—achieving straight-A results. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering at Qingdao University, where I participated in robotics competitions and gained hands-on experience in embedded systems, motion control, and computer vision, which is the topic of my undergraduate thesis.

Miscellaneous
===

**Sports: skiing, hiking, biking, table tennis**

I skied more than 5 times, with National Alpine Skiing Center as my favorite spot. I also like hiking and biking, especially in natural resorts. I'm also a table tennis player from a very young age.


**Traveling: 9 countries, more than half of domestic provinces**

Driven by my wanderlust, I have journeyed to 9 different countries (United States, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, France, Germany, Czechia, Austria, Hungary), and more than half of provinces and regions in China.

**Languages: CN, EN, DE, JP**

I'm a language enthusiast. My preferred languages: Chinese (native), English (IELTS7.5/GRE322), Cantonese (Non-native but colloquial), German (roughly B1) and Japanese (roughly N4).

Two persons I admire the most:  Geoffrey Hinton for his dedication to neural net research and Elon Musk for his aspiration and enthusiasm.
