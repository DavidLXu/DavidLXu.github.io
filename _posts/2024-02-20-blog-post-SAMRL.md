Key information
===
- Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is potentially more sample-efficient than model-free RL.
- Integration of differentiable physics-based simulation and rendering facilitates the learning process.
- Pipeline: Real2Sim -> Learn@Sim -> Sim2Real to produce efficient policies.
